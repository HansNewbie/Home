Modified from Android Legacy Home Sample

Development of this project is ceased on the basis that the base code depends on a very old SDK. I will try to make one launcher from scratch so as to stay up-to-date with more recent SDK. Thank you for your interest.

#Background Story
I wanted to make my own Android Launcher, a.k.a. homescreen. So I tried looking for sample code, and it came up from Android SDK. I tried runnning it on my Galaxy SIII and boy, it is broken. Some defects include low resolution and wallpaper not working correctly. I wanted to give up. But then, the spark in me started again. I tried looking for help online, but Stack Overflow only has one unanswered question on it (which in the end I answered rather vaguely - see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9455726/sample-android-launcher-is-in-phone-resolution-and-i-need-to-edit-it-for-a-table/18758573#18758573)). So, now I want to help those who are like me as much as I can (which probably is not much).

#How does this work?
So I try to improve the code. If it works, I will update the repo and GitHub Page (more on this later). I will try to put explanation on the improvement in [my blog](http://ideascomecheap.blogspot.sg/search/label/Android%20Home%20Sample) - please be patient since I may be busy and don't have the time to write. I will use the [GitHub Page of the repo](http://hansnewbie.github.io/Home/) to list the APK versions and some screenshot.

I do have my own vision of a good homescreen, so I may add my own flavour.
